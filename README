===================
Installing PyHesiod
===================

To install PyHesiod, you will first need to install Pyrex_. It's
always a good idea to install Pyrex through your package manager, if
possible. Your system's Pyrex package may be named ``python-pyrex`` or
``pyrex-py25``. If your package manager doesn't have a package for
Pyrex, or if you wish to install Pyrex by hand anyway, you can do so
by running::

  $ easy_install Pyrex

Once you've done that, to install PyHesiod globally, run::

  $ python setup.py install

If you want to build PyHesiod without installing it globally, you may
want to run::

  $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace

which will build the C extensions in place next to their source,
allowing you to import the various modules, so long as your current
working directory is the root of the PyHesiod source tree.

Alternatively, PyHesiod has been packaged for Debian and Ubuntu. To
build the Debian package of the latest release, run::

  $ git checkout debian
  $ git buildpackage
  $ sudo debi

You will need the devscripts and git-buildpackage packages installed,
as well as this package's build dependencies (cdbs, debhelper,
python-all-dev, python-support, python-pyrex, python-setuptools,
libhesiod-dev).
