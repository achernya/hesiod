This is public release 2.0.0 of the Hesiod name service library.
Hesiod can provide general name service for a variety of applications
and is based on the Berkeley Internet Name Daemon (BIND).

To prepare this directory for building, run the command "./configure".
configure takes a number of options; use "./configure --help" to find
out what they are.  Hesiod requires a vaguely ANSI compiler to build;
gcc will do.

Run "make" or "make all" to build the Hesiod library and programs.

Run "make install" to install Hesiod.

You will want to create a configuration file named /etc/hesiod.conf
(/usr/local/etc/hesiod.conf will also work, assuming you used the
default of /usr/local as your install prefix) on your client machines,
reading something like:

	rhs=your.domain
	lhs=ns

If you run named on your client machines, you will need to configure
it to know where to delegate queries of class HS.  Generally, this
configuration information should live in a file named something like
/etc/named.root or /etc/namedb/named.root, which should already exist
and specify the locations of the root name servers for class IN.  You
should add lines which look like:

	; Root HS servers
	.			3600000	HS	NS	server1.your.domain
	server1.your.domain.	3600000	HS	A	XXX.YYY.ZZZ.WWW
	server1.your.domain.	3600000	IN	A	XXX.YYY.ZZZ.WWW
	.			3600000	HS	NS	server2.your.domain
	server2.your.domain.	3600000	HS	A	XXX.YYY.ZZZ.WWW
	server2.your.domain.	3600000	IN	A	XXX.YYY.ZZZ.WWW

To actually create Hesiod information on your central name servers,
you need to make them authoritative for the domain ns.your.domain with
a line in named.boot reading something like:

	primary		ns.your.domain		named.hesiod

And then in named.hesiod, you need data looking something like:

	@	HS	SOA	server.your.domain admin-address.your.domain (
			40000	      ; serial - database version number
			1800	      ; refresh - sec servers
			300	      ; retry - for refresh
			3600          ; expire - unrefreshed data
			7200 )        ; min
		HS	NS	server1.your.domain
		HS	NS	server2.your.domain

	haynes.grplist	HS	TXT	"haynes:2638"
	zephyr.sloc	HS	TXT	"zephyrserver1.my.domain"
	zephyr.sloc	HS	TXT	"zephyrserver2.my.domain"

There is a mailing list at MIT for Hesiod users, hesiod@mit.edu.  To
